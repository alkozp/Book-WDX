### Javascript

- All JavaScript code is written inside "js" folder, which further divided into two folders:
  - "app" for small functionalities like fetching data and displaying data eg `book-template.js`
    - you can create any js file in this folder
  - "lib" folder for all the code we use for codrope demos

### CSS

- All Css Files goes in CSS folder which further divided into two folders:
  - "lib": for all codrope style sheets
  - "styles": for general global styling of the app
    - root css will holds all our variables for colors (background, font), typography etc
    - you can create file related to your task in this folder
- make sure to use only class and id
- Try to use ids or combination of selectors so we won't mix our styles
- If you decide to use classes use prefix of your task which you are working on eg  `footer-link` `nav-search-button`
- Avoid tag name like main or section or h1 or p this can mix your styles with other styling or you can also use inline styling in your elements

### HTML

- use Semantic html like  `section` `article` tags for content
- avoid generic html and use `div` and `span` only for styling purposes

### Assets

- Assets includes images that used on pages.

### Happy coding
